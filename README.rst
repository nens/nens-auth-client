nens-auth-client
==========================================

Introduction
------------

This library defines the necessary views and models to connect the AWS Cognito
user pool to the local django user database.

Usage: general
--------------

The nens-auth-client library exposes one django application: ``nens_auth_client``.
The django built-in apps ``auth``, ``sessions`` and ``contenttypes`` are
also required, but they probably are already there.
Add these to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting. The order is not important::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        "nens_auth_client",
        "django.contrib.auth",
        "django.contrib.contenttypes",
        "django.contrib.sessions",
        ...
    )

Also, add the following setting to be able to connect remote users to the local
Django user database::

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
        "django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend",
        "nens_auth_client.backends.RemoteUserBackend",
        "nens_auth_client.backends.EmailVerifiedBackend",
    ]

Some settings that set up our connection to the authorization server::

    NENS_AUTH_ISSUER = "https://cognito-idp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eu-west-1_9AyLE4ffV"
    NENS_AUTH_JWKS_URI = "https://cognito-idp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eu-west-1_9AyLE4ffV/.well-known/jwks.json"
    NENS_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL = "https://nens.auth.eu-west-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token"
    NENS_AUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL = "https://nens.auth.eu-west-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize"
    NENS_AUTH_LOGOUT_URL = "https://nens.auth.eu-west-1.amazoncognito.com/logout"


Usage: login/logout views
-------------------------

Some settings that identify your application as an OpenID Connect Client::

    NENS_AUTH_CLIENT_ID = "..."  # generate one on AWS Cognito
    NENS_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = "..."  # generate one on AWS Cognito
 
Include the ``nens-auth-client`` urls in your application's urls.py::

    from django.conf.urls import include

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r"^accounts/", include("nens_auth_client.urls", namespace="auth")),
        ...
    ]

You must register the absolute ``authorize`` and ``logout`` URIs in AWS Cognito.
If the site runs on multiple domains, they all have to be registered. Wildcards
are not possible because of security reasons.

Optionally set defaults for the redirect after successful login/logout::

    NENS_AUTH_DEFAULT_SUCCESS_URL = "/welcome/"
    NENS_AUTH_DEFAULT_LOGOUT_URL = "/goodbye/"


Usage: bearer tokens
--------------------

If your web application acts as a Resource Server in the Authorization Code
or Client Credentials Flow, then it will need to accept Bearer tokens in
http requests. ``nens-auth-client`` has a middleware for this::

    MIDDLEWARE = (
        ...
        "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",
        "nens_auth_client.middleware.AccessTokenMiddleware",
        ...
    )

This middleware will set the ``request.user.oauth2_scope`` that your
application may use for additional authorization logic.

Also, set the ``NENS_AUTH_RESOURCE_SERVER_ID``, which
should match the one set in the AWS Cognito. It needs a trailing slash::

    NENS_AUTH_RESOURCE_SERVER_ID = "..."  # configure this on AWS Cognito

Note that the above AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS have limited function here, because
bearer tokens typically do not include much information about the user. In a
default setup, a user should do a one-time login so that a ``RemoteUser`` is
created. After that, the user can be found by the "sub" claim in the
access token.

For the Client Credentials Flow there isn't any user. For that, a RemoteUser
should be created manually (with ``external_user_id`` equaling the client_id.
This could be attached to some service account.


User association logic
----------------------

The OpenID Connect flow provides an ID token to your client application. What
to do with that, is entirely up to the application. We like to use the built-in
django User models. To associate the externally provided user-id with a local
user, the django ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` are used.
See the `django docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/customizing/#customizing-authentication-in-django>`_.

In the nens-auth-client ``authorize`` view, the ``authenticate`` function from
django.contrib.auth is called with a keyword argument ``claims``. This
``claims`` equals the decoded ID token. It is up to the authentication
backends to return a ``user`` instance based on ``claims``.

In the default implementation nens-auth-client associates external users to
remote users via the ``RemoteUser`` model. If there is no existing association,
a user is selected by email address (if it is verified). This logic is contained
in the ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` setting:

- ``RemoteUserBackend`` produces a user if there is a RemoteUser present with
  its ``external_user_id`` matching ``claims["sub"]``
- ``EmailVerifiedBackend`` produces a user if there is one with an matching
  ``claims["email"]`` and if ``claims["email_verified"]`` is True.

At the end of the authentication chain, a ``RemoteUser`` object is created for
next time usage. This is skipped when the user was authenticated via the
``RemoteUserBackend``. Control this feature with ``NENS_AUTH_AUTO_CREATE_REMOTE_USER``.

If you application requires this logic to be appended, start with subclassing
``django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend`` and overriding the ``authenticate``
method with call signature ``(request: Request, claims: dict)``.

Local development
-----------------

(Re)create & activate a virtualenv::

    $ rm -rf .venv
    $ virtualenv .venv --python=python3
    $ source .venv/bin/activate

Install package and run tests::

    (virtualenv)$ pip install django==2.2
    (virtualenv)$ pip install -e .[test]
    (virtualenv)$ pytest
