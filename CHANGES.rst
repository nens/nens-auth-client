Changelog of nens-auth-client
===================================================


1.5.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Added Bearer token parsing to WSO2 client.

- Refactored the Cognito and WSO2 clients so they use the same baseclass.

1.5.0 (2024-02-19)
------------------

- Moved provider-specific logic (``extract_provider_name``, ``extract_username``) to
  to ``CognitoOAuthClient``.

- Made the OAuth2 provider backend configurable through ``NENS_AUTH_OAUTH_BACKEND``.

- Added ``WSO2OAuthClient`` for login using WSO2 Identity Server.

- Added the possibility of wildcards in ``NENS_AUTH_TRUSTED_PROVIDERS[_NEW_USERS]``.

- Usage of Bearer tokens with WSO2 is not (yet) supported; currently a NotImplementedError
  is raised with the token claims as argument.


1.4.4 (2024-01-26)
------------------

- Invitation: fixed bug in mail rendering (language)


1.4.3 (2024-01-26)
------------------

- Invitation: fixed bug in mail rendering


1.4.2 (2024-01-26)
------------------

- Invitation mail: Service email address is now interpolated, also added Dutch version


1.4.1 (2023-11-16)
------------------

- Fixed settings check introduced in 1.4.


1.4 (2023-11-14)
----------------

- Extended ``TrustedProviderMigrationBackend`` with creating new users.

- Extended the permission class with an `auto_assign` method for automatically
  assigning permissions based on the token claims.


1.3 (2023-10-25)
----------------

- Fixed deprecation warning by using JsonWebKey directly instead of calling
  jwk.loads.


1.2 (2023-03-20)
----------------

- oauthlib had a relevant breaking change in 1.1, so we require the latest
  1.2 version and adjust our code.

- Added ``TrustedProviderMigrationBackend`` for connecting users from specific
  external providers to their existing account, based on email. Email doesn't
  need to be verified, this turns out to be hard to set up properly in the
  claims that are send by external providers.

- Added ``NENS_AUTH_TRUSTED_PROVIDERS`` setting for configuring which external
  providers are trusted (see above).


1.1 (2022-05-20)
----------------

- Added ``AcceptNensBackend`` for automatically accepting N&S users without
  prior invitation. Handy for some internal websites.

- Solved ``@Nelen-Schuurmans.nl`` capitalization issue.


1.0 (2022-04-04)
----------------

- Do not raise an internal server error when users click 'backwards' or 'forwards' in
  the browser. Instead, restart the login process by redirecting to the login view.

- Fixed authlib 1.* compatibility.


0.14 (2022-03-14)
-----------------

- Added OAuth2TokenAuthentication as an alternative to the AccessTokenMiddleware when
  using django REST framework.


0.13 (2022-03-01)
-----------------

- Added requests_session.OAuth2Session to get a requests Session with an access token.
  If the access token expires the token is refreshed.

- Added requests_session.OAuth2CCSession for fetching an access token in the
  Client Credentials Grant.

- Fixed library with Django 4.*.

- Fixed unittests with authlib 0.15.5.


0.12 (2021-09-30)
-----------------

- Adapted code to match "NelenSchuurmans" as trusted provider name. It turned
  out that "Nelen&Schuurmans" had issues: the ampersand was not encoded in
  URLs being passed.

- Previously, local Nelen & Schuurmans users were automatically associated
  with their remote Google account. This now works for Azure AD accounts
  too, even if a Google association already exists.


0.11 (2021-09-21)
-----------------

- Extend SSOMigrationBackend so that it matches external users by username
  (from email) if it is an Azure AD account ending with @nelen-schuurmans.nl.

- Dropped support for Python 3.5. Added Python 3.9 to the versions to be
  tested.


0.10 (2021-02-23)
-----------------

- SSOMigrationBackend now matches usernames case-insensitively.


0.9 (2021-01-27)
----------------

- Fixed bug in AccessTokenMiddleware.


0.8 (2021-01-21)
----------------

- Pick the email as username for newly registered users coming from an external
  identity provider.

- Handle username uniqueness constraint by appending 4 random characters after
  the username when necessary.

- Added a check if the user's and invitation's email match. It does not matter
  whether the user's email was verified.

- Split the logout view in two. It is not used anymore as the callback url
  after remote logout: for that /logout-success/ is introduced. This so that
  users can always logout, also when local login failed.

- Added a logout and then login functionality. This can be used by calling
  /login?force_logout=true.

- Never require presence of "email" claim in the ID token.


0.7 (2021-01-13)
----------------

- Fixed faulty error message if user does not exist.

- Fixed authorize if there is no redirect in the session.

- Stop storing the default redirect urls in the session. This prevents creating
  a session in the login or logout flows if no 'next' url param is used.


0.6 (2021-01-11)
----------------

- Made all 403 error messages configurable. Some errors from the accept_invitation
  view are now a 403 instead of a 404.

- Added an invitation_accepted signal.

- Store tokens on the RemoteUser object and display them in the admin.

- Extend SSOMigrationBackend so that it matches external users by username
  (from email) if it is a Google account ending with @nelen-schuurmans.nl.


0.5 (2020-12-10)
----------------

- Fixed error when using authorize view with "invitation" query parameter.


0.4 (2020-12-08)
----------------

- Added Invitation model.

- The authorize view accepts an "invitation" query parameter. If the invitation
  is valid, a new user will be created. Or, if present, invitation.user will
  be used to log in.

- Added accept_invitation view.

- Added invitation expiry and a management command "clean_invitations".

- Removed the EmailVerifiedBackend.

- Added SSOMigrationBackend.

- Removed all secrets from the repository to be able to make it public.


0.3 (2020-10-20)
----------------

- Fix reverse() usage when urls are used in a namespace in another app.


0.2 (2020-10-16)
----------------

- Removed the NENS_AUTH_REDIRECT_URI and NENS_AUTH_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI. Instead
  we generate them from the authorize and logout view paths, respectively. Note
  that it requires all possible site domains to be registered with the
  Authorization Server.

- Django 1.11 compatibilty in urls.py.

- Set Cache-Control headers to "no-store" for login, authorize and logout.

- Added AccessTokenMiddleware enabling usage of this package in Resource
  Servers.

- Renamed "userinfo" to "claims" in the authentication backends.

- Error query parameters are handled in the authorize endpoint.

- NENS_AUTH_TIMEOUT is used in the token requests.

- Fix: inactive users can no longer log in.


0.1 (2020-09-29)
----------------

- Initial project structure created with cookiecutter and
  https://github.com/nens/cookiecutter-djangosite-template

- Added RemoteUser model.

- Added login, authorize and logout views for login/logout via OpenID Connect
  (AWS Cognito). Default settings are setup via django-appconf.

- Added unittests for login and authorize views.

- Added NENS_AUTH_ISSUER setting.

- Parsing the next query parameter in the login view. If it is unsafe or not
  provider, use ``NENS_AUTH_DEFAULT_SUCCESS_URL``.

- If already logged in, the login view redirects to the success_url directly.

- Added custom authentication backends "RemoteUserBackend" and
  "EmailVerifiedBackend" to associate remote user ids with local users.

- Call AWS LOGOUT endpoint in the logout view and added logout redirects.
